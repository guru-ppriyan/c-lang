/*//*What is a Dynamic Array in C?
A dynamic array is an array whose size can be changed at runtime, 
unlike a regular (static) array which must have a fixed size known at compile-time.

Why Use a Dynamic Array?
You donâ€™t know in advance how many elements you'll need.

You want to grow or shrink the array while the program is running
